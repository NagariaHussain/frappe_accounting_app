## Accounting App

A basic double entry accounting system built on Frappe.

This app was built by me to get a **hands-on experience** with the Frappe Framework. The main aim was to get familiar with the Frappe Framework and ERPNext codebases, and also to learn about the contribution guidelines for these projects.

This app has some basic functionalities available in the `Accounting` module of `ERPNext` with some custom portal pages like an e-store.
